    Plot any number of curve files using plotly.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    curve_type: str
        The name of the curve type to search for. For instance, "scores" will
        result in searching for scores. These curve types will be located in
        <state_path>/curves/. A the time of writing this, curve types are
        "scores", "episode_length", "runtime", "bs_min", "bs_max", "bs_avg".
    search_paths: array-like
        Paths to the policy curve files that you wish to plot. This can be paths
        to the actual curve files, directories containing the curve files,
        or directories containing sub-directories (at any depth) containing
        curve files. These curve files are numpy txt files.
    inclusive_search_patterns: array-like
        Only plot files that contain these strings within their paths.
        (while excluding all others). These are inclusive, meaning ALL
        of them need to appear in the file path.
    exclusive_search_patterns: array-like
        Only plot files that contain these strings within their paths.
        (while excluding all others). These are exclusive, meaning only
        ONE needs to appear in the file path.
    exclude_patterns: array-like
        Only plot files that don't contain these strings within their paths.
    status_constraints: dict
        A diciontary of status conditions. The should map status keys

        {'status_name_0' : ('comp_func_0', comp_val_0), 'status_preface'
        : {'status_name_1' : ('comp_func_1', comp_val_1)}} s.t. 'comp_func_i' is
        one of <, >, <=, >=, =.
    title: str
        The plot title to use.
    add_markers: bool
        If True, add markers to the line plots.
    grouping: bool
        If grouping is True, curves will be grouped together
        by their search paths. The deviation and mean of each group will be plotted.
    group_names: list
        An optional list of group names. If empty, a name will be auto-generated.
        If not empty, there must be a name for every group.
        Only applicable when grouping == True.
    group_deviation: str
        How should the deviation around the mean be plotted?
    deviation_min: float
        The minimum deviation to plot.
    deviation_max: float
        The maximum deviation to plot.
    floor: float
        Only plot curves that have the following characterstic: <floor>
        is exceeded at least once within the curve, AND, once <floor> has been
        exceeded, the curve never drops below <floor>.
    ceil: float
        Only plot curves that have the following characterstic: the
        curve drops below <ceil> at least once, AND, once the curve is
        below <ceil>, it never exceeds <ceil> again.
    top: int
        If > 0, only plot the highest <top> curves. Each curve is
        summed along the x axis before comparisons are made.
    bottom: int
        If > 0, only plot the lowest <bottom> curves. Each curve is
        summed along the x axis before comparisons are made.
    reduce_x_by: str
        How to reduce the x axis of curves before comparisons are made
        when using the <top> or <bottom> args.
    save_path: str
        Optional path to save a figure to instead of rendering in a window.
